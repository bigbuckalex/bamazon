# Bamazon

Bamazon is an Amazon-like CLI application utilizing a mySQL database. When the app is opened, the user is shown a list of available items, and is then prompted for the product id and quantity that they would like to buy. If there is enough in stock, the sale will go through and the quantity of the item will be updated in the database. If not, the user will be prompted again.
